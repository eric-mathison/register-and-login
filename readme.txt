Enable visitors to register and login to your site easily and securely.

== Description ==

Register and Login replaces the default way that users register and login on your Wordpress site.

Features include:
- Use dedicated pages instead of wp-login.php
- Allow users to chose their own secure password
- Easy User Switching for administrators
- Ability to log user registration and login times
- Support for Woocommerce
- Require login before checkout
- Fast SVG icons

First, this plugin will create a few pages so your users are provided a completely custom experience and not going to the default wp-login.php page. Then, you can choose to enable options such as logging when your users login and having the ability to impersonate the user if you need to do some troubleshooting.

If you are running Woocommerce, this plugin also provides you with several options to customize your checkout experience.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/register-and-login` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Goto Settings > Register and Login to enable the plugin's features
